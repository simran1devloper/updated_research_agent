In **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **CRAG** (or **Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation**) is a framework that enhances traditional RAG by incorporating **contextual reasoning** alongside retrieval-based augmentation. While the term isn't widely standardized, it generally refers to approaches that:

1. **Combine retrieval with reasoning** – Unlike basic RAG (which relies solely on document retrieval), CRAG integrates **logical inference** or **contextual understanding** to improve answer accuracy.
2. **Leverages structured knowledge** – It may use external knowledge bases (e.g., Wikidata, structured databases) to validate or refine retrieved information.
3. **Enhances with contextual awareness** – Some implementations use **prompt engineering** or **multi-hop reasoning** to ensure answers align with the retrieved context.

### **Key Variations of CRAG in RAG**
1. **Contextualized Retrieval** – Retrieval is dynamically adjusted based on the query’s intent (e.g., using embeddings or query-dependent filters).
2. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Augmentation** – The model generates intermediate reasoning steps before producing the final answer, using retrieved documents as evidence.
3. **Hybrid Retrieval + Reasoning** – Combines dense retrieval (e.g., BERT embeddings) with sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) and applies logical deduplication or validation.

### **Example Use Cases**
- **Medical RAG**: Retrieving clinical notes while cross-referencing with structured medical databases to ensure accuracy.
- **Legal RAG**: Combining case law retrieval with reasoning to derive nuanced legal conclusions.
- **Scientific RAG**: Using retrieved papers to validate hypotheses via multi-step reasoning.

### **Relation to Other RAG Variants**
- **RAG vs. CRAG**: RAG focuses on retrieval, while CRAG adds reasoning layers (e.g., via **Chain-of-Thought Prompting** or **Graph-Based Reasoning**).
- **CRAG vs. CoT**: While CoT is a reasoning technique, CRAG specifically ties it to retrieval-augmented contexts.
